I am an associate professor at Georgetown University's <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a>, and an academic affiliate with the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration.

In my research, I study how government reforms affect public employees and the people they serve, particularly with regard to social equity in access to public services and programs. I also work with public organizations to design and apply behavioral interventions to improve government effectiveness. Recently, I developed an interest in program evaluation and am currently the PI of an effort to link academic expertise with federal agencies to conduct impact evaluations of important social programs.

Since 2022, I serve as co-editor of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15206688" target="_blank">Journal of Policy Analysis and Managment (JPAM)</a>. I received the <a href="http://pmranet.org/awards/" target="_blank">Beryl Radin Award</a> for the best article published in the *Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory (JPART)*. I am also co-editor of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/experiments-in-public-management-research/8DB826A84D228568AAEC69732C72F1EC" target="_blank">*Experiments In Public Management Research: Challenges and Contributions*</a> (Cambridge University Press). In 2017, I co-founded the <a href="http://www.journal-bpa.org" target="_blank">Journal of Behavioral Public Administration</a>, a not-for-profit, open-access journal. I served as JBPA's editor-in-chief until 2021. 

Born in Germany, I received my master's in public administration from Zeppelin University (Germany), and PhD from Erasmus University Rotterdam (the Netherlands). Prior to joining Georgetown, I was an assistant professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers. 

My Erd≈ës Number is 6.
