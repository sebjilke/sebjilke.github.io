I am an associate professor at Georgetown University's <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a>, and an academic affiliate with the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration.

In my research, I study how government reforms affect public employees and the people they serve -- particularly with regard to social equity in access to public services and programs. I'm also interested in designing and applying (behavioral) interventions to improve government effectiveness more broadly, and am currently the PI of an <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/news/finding-out-what-works/" target="_blank">effort</a> to link academic expertise with federal agencies to conduct impact evaluations of important social programs.

I have worked with and provided advise to a wide range of organizations, including the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the Social Security Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, U.S. Department of Treasury/ IRS and the General Services Administration, as well as nonprofit/advocacy organizations such as the Equal Rights Center, and international organizations such as The World Bank. I have presented research to policymakers at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Chief Financial Officers Council, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. My work has also directly contributed to OMB policy guidance under President Biden.

Since 2022, I serve as co-editor of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15206688" target="_blank">Journal of Policy Analysis and Management (JPAM)</a>. Prior to that, I co-founded the <a href="http://www.journal-bpa.org" target="_blank">Journal of Behavioral Public Administration</a>, a not-for-profit, open-access journal. I served as JBPA's editor-in-chief until 2021. I am also co-editor of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/experiments-in-public-management-research/8DB826A84D228568AAEC69732C72F1EC" target="_blank">*Experiments In Public Management Research: Challenges and Contributions*</a> (Cambridge University Press). In 2017, I received the <a href="http://pmranet.org/awards/" target="_blank">Beryl Radin Award</a> for the best article published in the *Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory (JPART)*. 

Born in Germany, I received my master's in public administration from Zeppelin University (Germany), and PhD from Erasmus University Rotterdam (the Netherlands). Prior to joining Georgetown, I was an assistant professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers. 

My Erd≈ës Number is 6.
