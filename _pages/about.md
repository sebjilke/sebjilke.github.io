I am an associate professor at Georgetown University's <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a> -- my university profile can be found <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0031Q00002CYX4KQAX/sebastian-jilke" target="_blank">here</a>.  I'm also an academic affiliate with the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration, the  U.S. Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Homeland Security.

In my research, I study how government reforms affect public employees and the people they serve -- particularly with regard to social equity in access to public services and programs. I'm also interested in designing and applying (behavioral) interventions to improve government effectiveness more broadly, and am currently the PI of an <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/news/finding-out-what-works/" target="_blank">effort</a> to link academic expertise with federal agencies to conduct impact evaluations of important social programs.

My Erd≈ës Number is 6.
