I am the Provost's Distinguished Associate Professor at Georgetown University's <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a> -- my university profile can be found <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0031Q00002CYX4KQAX/sebastian-jilke" target="_blank">here</a>. At McCourt, I also co-direct BGL -- the <a href="https://www.bettergovernmentlab.org" target="_blank">Better Government Lab</a> --  which is a joint research center of Georgetown's McCourt School and the Ford School at the University of Michigan. I'm also an academic affiliate with the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration, and was an academic research affiliate with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Homeland Security.

In my research, I study how government reforms affect public employees and the people they serve -- especially with regard to access to public services and programs. I'm also interested in designing and applying interventions to improve government effectiveness more broadly. See <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/news/finding-out-what-works/" target="_blank">here</a> to get a taste of the applied nature of my work.

My Erd≈ës Number is 6.
