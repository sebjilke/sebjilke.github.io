I am the Provost's Distinguished Associate Professor at Georgetown University's <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a> -- my university profile can be found <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/0031Q00002CYX4KQAX/sebastian-jilke" target="_blank">here</a>. At McCourt, I also co-direct BGL -- the <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/better-government-lab/" target="_blank">Better Government Lab</a>. I'm also an academic affiliate with the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

In my research, I study how government reforms affect public employees and the people they serve -- particularly with regard to social equity in access to public services and programs. I'm also interested in designing and applying (behavioral) interventions to improve government effectiveness more broadly, and how these interventions can be implemented at scale. See <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/news/finding-out-what-works/" target="_blank">here</a> to get a taste of the applied nature of my work.

My Erd≈ës Number is 6.
