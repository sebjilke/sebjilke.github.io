I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Public Affairs and Administration</a> at Rutgers University-Newark where I am also co-directing the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/cebpa" target="_blank">Center for Experimental and Behavioral Public Administration</a>.  During the Academic Year 2019-2020, I serve as Fellow in the <a href="https://oes.gsa.gov" target="_blank">Office of Evaluation Sciences</a> at the General Services Administration in Washington, D.C.  In August 2020, I will be joining the <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">McCourt School of Public Policy</a> at Georgetown University.

My academic work applies insights from the behavioral sciences to public management and policy.  Substantively, I am interested in how institutional arrangements for public service delivery affect public employees and the people they serve -- especially with regard to social equity in access to public services and programs.  I also work with public organizations in the US and abroad to design and apply behavioral interventions to improve government effectiveness across different domains. 

I received the <a href="https://pmranet.org/awards/" target="_blank">Beryl Radin Award</a> for the best article published in the *Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory (JPART)*. I am also co-editor of <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/experiments-in-public-management-research/8DB826A84D228568AAEC69732C72F1EC" target="_blank">*Experiments In Public Management Research: Challenges and Contributions*</a> (Cambridge University Press), and founding editor (together with Ken Meier and Gregg Van Ryzin) of the <a href="http://www.journal-bpa.org" target="_blank">Journal of Behavioral Public Administration</a>, a not-for-profit, open-access journal.  I co-chair the EGPA Permanent Study Group XXII on <a href="https://egpa.iias-iisa.org/EGPA_STUDY_GROUPS.php" target="_blank">Behavioral Public Administration</a>.
